Some things I wish I had macros for sometimes.

## An aside

Just because everything is possible under the sun at compile-time, doesn't mean
you can or should. It's very easy to write unreadable code, even without
metaprogramming.

Consider the debts you are shuffling around while programming: time the user of
your code writes more code. Time the compiler spends compiling. Time the user
spends waiting for your program. Time you spend writing a useful program.
Optimize wisely.
